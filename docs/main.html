<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<h3 id="web-architecture">Web Architecture</h3>
<p>Describe here, with a diagram, the components of your web application and how</p>
<p>they interact. Highlight which parts belong to the application layer, data layer</p>
<p>or presentation layer. How did you ensure that HTML is not rendered server side?</p>
<h3 id="api">API</h3>
<h4 id="rest-compliance">REST compliance</h4>
<p>Describe here to what extent did you follow REST principles and what are the</p>
<p>reasons for which you might have decided to diverge. Note, you must not describe</p>
<p>the whole API here, just the design decisions.</p>
<h4 id="openapi-resource-models">OpenAPI Resource models</h4>
<p>Describe here synthetically, which models you have introduced for resources.</p>
<h3 id="data-model">Data model</h3>
<p>Describe with an ER diagram the model used in the data layer of your web</p>
<p>application. How these map to the OpenAPI data model?</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<h3 id="tools-used">Tools used</h3>
<p>Describe here which tools, languages and frameworks did you use for the backend</p>
<p>of the application.</p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>Describe here:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did you make sure your web application adheres to the provided OpenAPI</li>
</ul>
<p>specification?</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do you think your web application adheres to common practices to partition</li>
</ul>
<p>the web application (static assets vs. application data)</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe synthetically why and how did you manage session state, what are the</li>
</ul>
<p>state change triggering actions (e.g., POST to login etc…).</p>
<ul>
<li>Which technology did you use (relational or a no-SQL database) for managing</li>
</ul>
<p>the data model?</p>
<h2 id="other-information">Other information</h2>
<h3 id="task-assignment">Task assignment</h3>
<p>Describe here how development tasks have been subdivided among members of the</p>
<p>group, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Foo worked on front end (80%) and OpenAPI Spec (20% of the time)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bar worked on …</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="analysis-of-existing-api">Analysis of existing API</h3>
<p>Describe here if you have found relevant APIs that have inspired the OpenAPI</p>
<p>specification and why (at least two).</p>
<h3 id="learning-outcome">Learning outcome</h3>
<p>What was the most important thing all the members have learned while developing</p>
<p>this part of the project, what questions remained unanswered, how you will use</p>
<p>what you’ve learned in your everyday life?</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foo learned to write SQL queries and Javascript but wanted to know more about</li>
</ul>
<p>caching, he’s probably going to create his own startup with what she has</p>
<p>learned</p>
<ul>
<li>Bar learned how to deploy on a cloud platform, he would have liked to know</li>
</ul>
<p>more about promises for asynchronous code…</p>
